## Deliverable

Script storing text docs & retrieving by semantic similarity — index small dataset and demonstrate top-k results
RAG with OpenAI + Pinecone


- Converts text into embeddings using OpenAI
- Stores embeddings in Pinecone
- Converts user queries into embeddings
- Performs vector similarity search
- Returns the most relevant stored documents

## Setup

- activate venv
- install dependencies (openai pinecone_client jupyter)


## This project requires apikeys for both openai and pinecone# Flexisaf_Task_5
